My custom node.js server

I don't really know why I made this.

It started when I was first learning how to write websites, and now I have a bunch of websites dependant on it so rather than update those websites, I'm just going to maintain this server.


To use it, put a folder in "websites" with a config file describing the domains you want that website to be served to.

You can run the server on an amazon ec2 instance, and then sync the HTML and config folder with dropbox, and it makes for pretty easy development.

Good for hackathons and things.

Please don't use this for anything serious.

Cheers,
