Be my lover, my lady river

The clouds above opened up and let it out
I was standing on the surface of a perforated sphere
When the water filled every hole
And thousands upon thousands made an ocean
Making islands where no islands should go (oh no)

Most people were overjoyed; they took to their boats
I thought it less like a lake and more like a moat
The rhythm of my footsteps crossing flatlands to your
Door have been silenced forevermore
And the distance is quite simply much to far for me to row;
It seems farther than ever before (oh no)

I need you so much closer

So come on; come on"

To be alone with you
To be alone with you
To be alone with you

You gave your body to the lonely
They took your clothes
You gave up a wife and a family
You gave your goals

To be alone with me
To be alone with me
To be alone with me
You went up on a tree
Aah, aah, aah

To be alone with me
You went up on the tree
Aah, aah, aah

I've never known the man who loved me
Aah, aah, aah"

Wanna hold you like a prisoner in the arms of my remand
Caught for good
Because to leave you with those days is never something i could do
There'll always be a part of me that needs to be with you
That's just what's true
There you were black silver dressed in gold
Like every story ever told
A million words in so few sentences
When you spoke to me it rang out like a song
That dared all ears to hear it wrong
To never know to never see to never reach a place to be 
To never understand your way has put a limit on my days

So long it's too late
So i said heart, translate
Cause i dont understand a thing that you say
Maybe we'll see it all as it's fading away
Different memories will come
Different seasons and days
And as long as it takes
Oh the heart it translates
It can never be wrong
It can only be late"

To make the other one leave

When we were alone
When we were alone

So I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you

And we stole
Every moment we had to make the other one feel bad
And we hoped that we could be what we knew
We'd never turn out to be real

And I loved the way you looked at me
And I miss the way you made me feel
When we were alone

When we were alone

And I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you

And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live life
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live life
And if we turn back time
Could we learn to live life
And if we turn back time
Could we learn

And I'll shiver like I used to
And I'll leave him just for you
And I'll shiver like I used to
Just for you

Just me in an empty room on a single bed
Iʼve been trying all this time just to see
All the reasons you had given just to leave

Why am I so bitter about you babe
I donʼt understand
Was I trying to cash in the fantasy without the reality check
But I never wanted you to lie to yourself about happiness
When all you were was just a little lonely

Latching on to love like a moth to flame
But what are we gonna do when the embers start to fade
I donʼt mean to mess with the master plan
But when you put out the fire Iʼll just start it again
I guess Iʼll have to keep my distance for your defense

Pull me out of focus keep me in the queue
Iʼm a tired lover wilting hours in the waiting room
Embrace the silence when thereʼs nothing left
You got no room for demons when youʼre self-possessed

Why am I so bitter about you babe
I donʼt understand
Every time youʼre out in the sunshine
And Iʼll just sleep through it
But I never wanted you to lie to yourself about happiness
When all you were was just a little lonely
And all you wanted was the company

Whyʼd you let me go
When you still wanna know
How much I care If Iʼd still be there
Whyʼd you set me free
If you need the sympathy
Come as you are
My tongue is undone

Was I spoilt for love
Have you had enough
Wait out the danger
You donʼt have to ask
This maudlin moment
Will soon come to pass"

But I can't stop listening to the sound
Of two soft voices
Blended in perfection
From the reels of this record that I've found.

Every day there's a boy in the mirror asking me...
What are you doing here?
Finding all my previous motives
Growing increasingly unclear.

I've traveled far and I've burned all the bridges
I believed as soon as I hit land
All the other options held before me,
Would wither in the light of my plan.

So I'll lose some sales and my boss won't be happy,
But there's only one thing on my mind
Searching boxes underneath the counter,
On a chance that on a tape I'd find...
A song for someone who needs somewhere to long for.

Homesick.
Because I no longer know where home is."

Birds in the trees as we run through
And if I'm dead to the world, what you gon' do? What you gon' do?
Like, (I can't remember)
Shots fired, rewind, please, girl, be mine
Email denied, talk to me baby
Before I go crazy, might do it maybe
We were so Jay Z & Beyonce, my aunt say \"keep the sex game picante\"
The Aunt May and Mary Jane that I was hitting on
We were trying to forget that there was something wrong
Love is Russian roulette, I had the safety on
We popped pills at the Coachella
Hold my head in the weeds, man I can't tell her
The fear that I feel man it might kill her
Man, it might kill her, it's the prep school mic killa'
With the drums and the groove so it feel Dilla
I don't care what he say
I'ma get my platinum back like I'm a half ton gorilla
You can hang with homie on the low
But your boy so weak like a week ago
But we ain't speaking though

Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you
Tuesday afternoon, I ain't got shit to do
But fall in love with you

Love me better, kiss me back, Listen more oh
Love me better, kiss me back, listen more"

In the arms of mothers
In the parts we play to convince others
We know what we're doing
We're doing it right

May have written books on the subject
But then you may still be surprised
by your tone over the phone
to your sister while waiting in line
at the shopping mall just outside a town

In the hands of teachers
In the books you read
The things you say when we're lost the lead
I still try to speak up but my voice won't make a sound
And I thought it all over too many times

But when there is no use
And the lights are all out
I just give it up and I walk home
Past the shopping mall
That's just closing down

Will you tell yourself,
you all must be what you'll be
Who's to say who is who and what is what
If you simply don't agree
Now, time will come to claim you
And it will have its way
Don't make mistakes and don't regret
Don't waste the time that is left
And then do it all with a goddamn smile

In the hearts of men
In the arms of mothers
In the parts we play to convince others"

The pressure of days
Do what I say

People you've been before
That you don't want around anymore
That push and shove and won't bend to your will
I'll keep them still

Drink up baby, look at the stars
I'll kiss you again between the bars
Where I'm seeing you there
With your hands in the air
Waiting to finally be caught

Drink up one more time
And I'll make you mine
Keep you apart,
Deep in my heart
Separate from the rest,
Where I like you the best
And keep the things you forgot

That push and shove and won't bend to your will

Have dried on yesterday 
The sea of fools has parted for us 
There's nothing in our way 
My love 

Don't you see, don't you see? 
You're just the torch to put the flame to all our guilt and shame 
And I'll rise like an ember in your name 

I know I, I know I 
I know everybody here wants you 
I know everybody here thinks he needs you 
I'll be waiting right here just to show you 
Oh let me show you 
That love can rise, rise just like embers 

Love can taste like the wine of the ages, oh babe, 
And I know they all looks so good from a distance 
But I tell you I'm the one

Think he needs you

One night to be confused
One night to speed up truth
We had a promise made
Four hands and then away

Both under influence
We had divine scent
To know what to say
Mind is a razor blade

To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no

One night of magic rush
The start a simple touch
One night to push and scream
And then relief

Ten days of perfect tunes
The colors red and blue
We had a promise made
We were in love

To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no

To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough

And you, you knew the hands of the devil
And you, kept us awake with wolf teeth
Sharing different heartbeats
In one night

To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no

To call for hands of above
To lean on
Wouldn't be good enough
For me, no"

They, they do nothing
Now that you're missing something
You wanna leave the world with me

I can't be the same thing to you now
I'm just gone, just gone
How could I say goodbye
How could I say goodbye
Goodbye

Maybe I'll just place my hands over you
And close my eyes real tight
There's a light in your eyes
And you know--yeah, you know
Look on down from the bridge
I'm still waiting for you"

I should go now quietly
For my bones have found a place
to lie down and sleep
Where all my layers can become reeds
All my limbs can become trees
All my children can become me
What a mess I leave
To follow
To follow
To follow
To follow

In the darkness I will meet my creators

Listening to the rain falling from the midnight sky

I wish that time was our friend, was our friend
but he mocks us with the knowledge that good things have to end
and we’re hollowed like a shell as our memories start to rust
but I don’t want to forget him, my first love

East of morning i loved what was lost I’ve left him so lonely in the bed where we shared our first taste of flesh as he bit into my neck like a fox and I’m a rabbit

Like a fox and i’m a rabbit playing dead
Like a fox and I’m a rabbit playing dead"

The wisdom of the fool won't set you free
But that's the way that it goes
And it's what nobody knows
well every day my confusion grows

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray
I'm waiting for that final moment
You say the words that I can't say

I feel fine and I feel good
I'm feeling like I never should
Whenever I get this way
I just don't know what to say
Why can't we be ourselves like we were yesterday
I'm not sure what this could mean
I don't think you're what you seem
I do admit to myself
That if I hurt someone else
Then I'll never see just what we're meant to be

Every time I see you falling
I get down on my knees and pray

You say the words that I can't say"

Some kind of night into your darkness
Colors your eyes with what's not there.

Fade into you
Strange you never knew
Fade into you
I think it's strange you never knew

A stranger's light comes on slowly
A stranger's heart without a home
You put your hands into your head
And then smiles cover your heart

I'll remember long drives, sitting in the back
Looking out and endless snow,
Waiting in the silence, if you won't spill your heart,
I'll chase you for the words you owe
And you and you know and they're begging \"come home\"
And you and you know and they're begging \"come home\"

Tiny knots in my belly when you come around

The time with that with that

Shifting gears in my mind like machinery

You take your shoes off in the back of my van
My shirt looks so good
When it's just hanging off your back
And she said use your hands and my spare time
We've got one thing in common it's this tongue of mine
She said she's got a boyfriend anyway

There's only minutes before I drop you off
And all we seem to do it talk about sex
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
I love your friend when I saw his film
He's got a funny face but I like that because he still looks cool
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway

Now we are on the bed in my room
And I'm about to fill his shoes
But you say no
But do you say no
Does he take care of you
Or could I easily fill his shoes
Do you say no
Do you say no

And now we're just outside of town
And you're making your way down
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway
And I'm not trying to stop you love
But if we're gonna do anything we might as well just fuck
She's got a boyfriend anyway
She's got a boyfriend anyway"

Begin Again
Begin Again

I've been watching your kindness keep
A lonely company
Look at the fire and think of me
I've been watching you creep
Around my wandering feet
Trying for years to flee

I need not one thing more
O wrap the ground around
Your gentle winding mind
O guard the pounding sound
Breathe in your fiery air
O wrap the ground around
Give back an hungrier stare
O guard the pounding sound

You be the moon I'll be the earth
And when we burst
Start over o darling
Begin again
Begin again
Begin again [x2]

My moon o my moon
Not even into
Another eternity
Will you stop your lovely orbiting
I had held it a world away
Until my body 'gan to say

I need not one thing more
O wrap the ground around
Your gentle winding mind
O guard the pounding sound
Breathe in your fiery air
O wrap the ground around
Give back an hungrier stare
O guard the pounding sound

You be the moon I'll be the earth
And when we burst
Start over o darling
Begin again
Begin again
Begin again
Begin again"

My accent on the phone
When I call across the country
When I call across the world
I see you in my kitchen
I can picture you now
As you toast to your small town
And you drink the happy hour
I'm in London still
I'm in London still
I'm in London still
I took the tube over to Camden
To wander around
I bought some funky records
With that old motown sound
And I miss you like my left arm
That's been lost in a war
Today I dream of home and not of London anymore
I'm in London still
I'm in London still
Yeah I'm in London still
You know it's ok
I'm kinda happy here for now
I think I've finally grown up
And got myself a love of now
If I ever come home and I, I think I will
I hope you're gonna want to hang
At my place on Sundays still
Oh yeah I hope you will
'Cause I'm in London still
You know we got it sorted
We really got it down
To a fine art on Sunday
In our sleepy Sunday town
I wonder what I'm missing
I think of songs I've never heard
I'm dreaming of your voices
And I'm dreaming of your herb
I'm in London still
I'm in London still
I'm in London still
Oh I'm in London still
La la la la London still
I'm in London..."

6000 Miles feel so alone
6000 Miles Have to travel
6000 Miles to get back home

And I'd have to sail oceans boundless
I'd have to cross endless skies
Tonight I do dream I can grow wings
And I can fly, that 6000 miles back home to you

I traded you for some great adventure
Stepped out into worlds unknown
To far away lands, did I wander
Deserts and mountains, I now roam
Well I just cant let go, of your golden shores
And I still crave your salted air
And if I was standing on the edge of heaven on earth tonight
I couldn't care about anything less
Than 6000 miles

I never really had much of a way with words
But god knows, I love to sing
The feel of the sound coming through me
The feel of the joy inside that it brings
And so here tonight I am your minstrel, and you be my silent beating drum
Whenever that music plays inside us, not even oceans
Not even oceans, can keep us apart
Not even, 6000 miles"

A heart that feels like running

The way that I see you there
While my chest comes undone
Like water runs and crests
No cease in this beating drum

Tailor don't leave here yet
The silk we're seeking
Starts as thread
Tailor go easy
I know you don't see it but
It starts as thread

I see the dark clouds bloom
But I don't need a saviour
So come in I'll take you
Down here I'll lay you
Only warm and only true

I hear those mountains call
For something more but there's nothing more
Than running my hands through your fresh cut hair
And your shape as winter falls."

Swear I was born right in the doorway
I went out in the rain suddenly everything changed
They're spreading blankets on the beach

Yours is the first face that I saw
I think I was blind before I met you
Now I don't know where I am
I don't know where I've been
But I know where I want to go

And so I thought I'd let you know
That these things take forever
I especially am slow
But I realize that I need you
And I wondered if I could come home

Remember the time you drove all night
Just to meet me in the morning
And I thought it was strange you said everything changed
You felt as if you'd just woke up
And you said \"this is the first day of my life
I'm glad I didn't die before I met you
But now I don't care I could go anywhere with you
And I'd probably be happy\"

So if you want to be with me
With these things there's no telling
We just have to wait and see
But I'd rather be working for a paycheck
Than waiting to win the lottery
Besides maybe this time is different
I mean I really think you like me"

With or without a boat

If we'd hidden a bit better
We'd be strangers 

And this breeze blew in
With a glitch in the tide
Disguised as storm free
Begging you please to take a ride
Well soften your sails and take a ride
Open your wings and let her fly 

And I can't see the point sometimes
You're a rock, I'm a gull
Might be okay to stay if you could hold me
But you got no way to do so
And you know
That as the water rises
Possible perch shrinks in size
And I'll take off 

And this breeze blew in
With a glitch in the tide
Disguised as storm free
Begging you please to take a ride
Well soften your sails and take a ride
Open the wings and let her fly 

And you know that nothing lasts forever
And depending on the weather
I'm a changer
I'm a changer
I'm a changer

How I know your face, all the ways you move, you come in, I can read you
You're my favourite book
All the things you say, the way you shift your eyes
I never knew there was someone, to make me come alive

When the days are long, and the thunder with the storm, can always get me crying
You can make my bed, I'll fall into it, shattered but not lonely
Because I never knew a home, until I found your hands, when I'm weathered
You come to me, you're my best friend

And that is why we'll always make it

How I know your face, all the ways you move, you come in, I can read you
You're my favourite book
All the things you say, the way you shift your eyes
I never knew there was someone, to make me come alive

And when we're making love
I'd give up everything up for your touch

How I know your face, all the ways you move, you come in, I can read you
You're my favourite book
All the things you say, the way you shift your eyes
I never knew there was someone, to make me come alive

When you go to work all the day I wait
For you to come home, recount our time, in our little place"

I went out in the rain

I didn't understand then
I don't understand now

Am I the one you think about when you're sitting in your faintin' chair drinking pink rabbits?
Am I the one you think about when you're sitting in your faintin' chair drinking pink rabbits?

And everybody was gone
You were standin' in the street 'cause you were tryin' not to crack up
It wasn't like a rain it was more like a sea
I didn't ask for this pain it just came over me
I love a storm, but I don't love lightning
All the waters coming up so fast, that's frightening

Am I the one you think about when you're sitting in your faintin' chair drinking pink rabbits?
Am I the one you think about when you're sitting in your faintin' chair drinking pink rabbits?

And everybody was gone
I was standing in the street 'cause I was trying not to crack

I was solid gold
I was in the fight
I was coming back from what seemed like a ruin
I couldn't see you coming so far
I just turn around and there you are

I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
I was just getting used to living life without you around
I'm so surprised you want to dance with me now
You always said I held you way too high off the ground

You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in the park
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a white girl in a crowd of white girls in a park
You didn't see me I was falling apart
I was a television version of a person with a broken heart

And everybody was gone
You were standin' in the street 'cause you were trying not to crack up
And bona drag was still on
Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sun kicks out
Now I only think about Los Angeles when the sun kicks out

You said it would be painless
The needle in the doll
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all
You said it would be painless
The needle in the doll
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all (when the sun kicks out)

You said it would be painless
The needle in the doll (when the sun kicks out)
You said it would be painless
It wasn't that at all"

Welcome home

Ships are launching from my chest
Some have names but most do not
If you find one, please let me know what piece I've lost

Heal the scars from off my back
I don't need them anymore
You can throw them out or keep them in your mason jars
I've come home

All my nightmares escaped my head
Bar the door, please don't let them in
You were never supposed to leave
Now my head's splitting at the seams
And I don't know if I can

Here, beneath my lungs, I feel your thumbs press into my skin again"

They're stunned by all your charm
And I feel so damn lucky
To have you on my arm
And I can't help but wonder
How we ended up alright
And I love you like no other
Cause this has never felt so right

You can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
You can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
I want to treat you something special
Give you what you deserve
I want to take you to paradise
In a 1950's Merc
And I can't help but wonder
Just how we ended up alright
And I love you like no other
And this has never felt so right

You can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
You can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
Girl you can keep me warm
You can keep me real warm
There's just one thing
Girl you could have anyone
So why you choosing me and not leaving me on my own
Girl you could be with anyone
So thanks for making me your number one

You can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
You can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
Wrap me up and keep warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night
Oh yeah you can keep me warm on a cold night
Warm on a cold cold night"

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
(Love yourz)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive
Don't be sleepin' on you lover cause its beauty in the struggle nigga
Goes for all y'all
It's beauty in the struggle nigga
It's beauty in the struggle nigga, ugliness in the success
Hear my words or listen to my signal of distress
I grew up in the city and though some times we had less
Compared to some of my niggas down the block man we were blessed
And life can't be no fairytale, no once upon a time
But I be God damned if a nigga don't be tryin'
So tell me mama please why you be drinking all the time?
Does all the pain he brought you still linger in your mind?
Cause pain still lingers on mine
On the road to riches listen this is what you'll find
The good news is nigga you came a long way
The bad news is nigga you went the wrong way
You think being broke is better

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

For what's money without hapiness?
Or hard times without the people you love
Though I'm not sure what's 'bout to happen next
I asked for strength from the Lord up above
Cause I've been strong so far
But I can feel my grip loosening
Quick, do something before you lose it for good
Get it back and use it for good
And touch the people how you did like before
I'm tired of living with demons cause they always inviting more
Think being broke was better
Now I don't mean that phrase with no disrespect
To all my niggas out there living in debt
Cashing minimal checks
Turn on the TV see a nigga Rolex
And fantasize about a life with no stress
I mean this shit sincerely
And that's a nigga who was once in your shoes
Living with nothin' to lose
I hope one day you hear me
Always gon' be a bigger house somewhere, but nigga feel me
'Long as the people in that motherfucker love you dearly
Always gon' be a whip that's better than the the one you got
Always gon' be some clothes that's fresher than the one's you rock
Always gon' be a bitch that's badder out there on the tours
But you ain't never gon' be happy till you love yours

No such thing as a life that's better than yours
(Love yourz)
No such thing as a life that's better than yours
No such thing, no such thing

Heart beatin' fast, let a nigga know that he alive
Fake niggas mad, snakes in the grass let a nigga know that he arrive"

That a tiny little thing, like the sun will once be gone

Besides you and I will both be gone

I should be digging my way to China
with a shovel
But winded up in Portugal
Oh it's a long way to crawl
And I missed the earth and its blue walls

But when I pop my head up in Hiroshima
Heaven is just like earth only upside down
And I carelessly walk around
I carelessly walk around

Nananana..

Nobody hurts like me for you.
Soft slacks at night, I'm wearing 'em tight,
Nobody hurts like I do.

Your fakers are fine, but your water ain't wine,
so stop feeding me, 'a little more time'.
Your shit's a mess, I'm not yours to undress,
I'm leaving this love for the last time.
I'm not yours, I'm mine.

You've got the means to caress, but weak you leave me a mess.
One touch is enough, your hands, a little too rough. 

Will I ever be enough?
I'm not yours, I'm mine.

We fall the fader to black, release the ropes and feel the slack.
I'm not yours, I'm mine. 
I tell you every time, you're walking a fine, fine line.
I'm not yours, I'm mine.
I'm not yours.

Heard it all before
Heard it all before"

I'm keeping the bed warm while her husband is away
He's on the British side in Georgia
He's trying to keep the colonies in line
But he can keep all of Georgia
Theodosia, she's mine

Love doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep loving anyway
We laugh and we cry
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there's a reason I'm by her side
When so many have tried
Then I'm willing to wait for it
I'm willing to wait for it


My grandfather was a fire and brimstone preacher


Preacher, preacher
Preacher


But there are things that the
Homilies and hymns won't teach ya


Teach ya, teach ya, teach ya


My mother was a genius

Genius


My father commanded respect


Respect, respect


When they died they left no instructions
Just a legacy to protect

Death doesn’t discriminate
Between the sinners
And the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes
And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall
And we break
And we make our mistakes
And if there’s a reason I’m still alive
When everyone who loves me has died
I’m willing to wait for it
I’m willing to wait for it

Wait for it


Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it


I am the one thing in life I can control


Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it


I am inimitable
I am an original


Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it


I’m not falling behind or running late


Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it
Wait for it


I’m not standing still
I am lying in wait


Wait
Wait
Wait


Hamilton faces an endless uphill climb


Climb
Climb
Climb


He has something to prove
He has nothing to lose


Lose
Lose
Lose
Lose


Hamilton’s pace is relentless
He wastes no time


Time
Time
Time


What is it like in his shoes?

Hamilton doesn’t hesitate
He exhibits no restraint
He takes and he takes and he takes
And he keeps winning anyway
He changes the game
He plays and he raises the stakes
And if there’s a reason
He seems to thrive when so few survive, then Goddamnit—


I'm willing to wait for it


Wait for it
Wait for...


I'm willing to wait for it...


Life doesn't discriminate
Between the sinners and the saints
It takes and it takes and it takes


And we keep living anyway
We rise and we fall and we break
And we make our mistakes


We rise
And we fall


And if there's a reason I'm still alive
When so many have died
Then I'm willin' to—


Wait for it...


Wait for it...
Wait for it...


Wait for it...


Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait for it...
Wait...

But I fear for it's grace 
Shoot for the sky 
Opens up like the sea 
And the resinous high 
Bloodlines and divines
Will my kids see the trees?
Will the glen fall on me?

I was hoping you would walk with me
Down the Aisles of Light gallery 
Leave a child with legacy
We lay, we lay, we lay
All day

And when she came 
I grabbed her head
And dipped her in the lake
And seldom seen, a side of me 
Beneath my feet the earthen shake 
I can't calm down
I'm flooding in spring
And swelling from the sound
And I am driftwood found "

I was thinking mildly in my days
That I might be leaving like I should
In my dawn ???

Should I go
Should I know
Could I go
How could I explain
All those things to you

And how loud does the wind blow
While we sleep away our days
I was thinking maybe there's a willow
Forgives while under her gaze


Should I know
Could I be fooled
Would I strew
Only if I could
With you

Should I roam
Could I be owned
While I'm still here
On my own
With you, with you"

You must be somewhere in London
You must be loving your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London
Walking Abbey Lane

I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make corrections

Famous angels never come through England
England gets the ones you never need
I'm in a Los Angeles cathedral
Minor singing airheads sing for me

Put an ocean and a river
Between everybody else,
Between everything, yourself, and home
Put an ocean and a river
Between everything, yourself, and home

You must be somewhere in London
You must be loving your life in the rain
You must be somewhere in London
Walking Abbey Lane

I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make
I don't even think to make corrections

Famous angels never come through England
England gets the ones you never need
I'm in a Los Angeles cathedral
Minor singing airheads sing for me

Afraid of the house, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house, stay the night with the sinners
Afraid of the house, 'cause they're desperate to entertain"
