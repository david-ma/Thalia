My boyfriend really likes 1 of the craft beers on tap but I cannot remeber what it was called. They also have the most amazing Maple cheese fries... at first I was like EW but after actually trying them they are glorious.

The Australian pays the bill. I would spend at least $30,000, maybe $40,000 a year on food. A lot of the bloggers are just writing about freebies.”\n\nDear John Lethlean, you might be surprised to know that many food bloggers are spending their own hard earned money on paying for their own meals. Food bloggers then share their finds for free via instagram, twitter, facebook and their blogs which in essence is promoting the restaurants and cafes they've dined at. A majority of my own personal disposable income goes towards spending it on food and I can't claim that back like you can and all the other food critics that get paid to eat out. If you're out in a nice restaurant and paying say a $300 bill out of your own money but then claiming it back the next day from your employer then you're not actually paying with your own money, you've just received a free meal and you're being sponsored by your employer. You are personally eating for free and technically getting freebies. That's how I see it. Unless of course you're a financial partner in the company and then you'd be footing for the expenses in the end.\n\nOh and 'I started taking photos a long time before the food blogger ever emerged.' Not quite sure of the relevance of stating this in the article besides trying to elude to saying you were like the inventor of taking photos of your food with a camera? I started taking photos of my food long before I even knew what food blogging was and I'm sure every person that has ever travelled overseas with a camera has taken photos at one time or another of some interesting dish to show their friends and family back home and they're not food bloggers.\n\nAlso booking under a different name seems a bit unnecessary and flawed since once you walk in the door any high profile restaurant will know who you are by now. Or perhaps they don't so really there's no need to actually change your name because they don't know about you anyway. Even if you booked with your own name doesn't mean you'll actually get special treatment. When a restaurant is busy you'll notice any squeaky wheels and how they operate within minutes. I've dined at places with the owners sitting at the table and we've received bad service. It just highlights were improvements need to be made and sometimes things simply can't be hidden even if they know you're a food critic like yourself. \n\nI've always booked under my own name. But perhaps I should start booking it under John Lethlean, Terry Durack, Pat Nourse or Myffy Rigby and see what happens when I arrive. Might be quite funny or maybe they'd just think I have the same name as these food critics or actually wouldn't know who they are anyway.","http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/aussie-food-critics-hit-back-at-claims-their-reviews-arent-independent/story-fn93ypt9-1227145109772","https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152634510243533","Sydney Food Bloggers"],[null,"December 04, 2014 at 11:51PM","Romina Panetta","Hi guys, I'm new to this group.

The Australian pays the bill. I would spend at least $30,000, maybe $40,000 a year on food. A lot of the bloggers are just writing about freebies.”\n\nDear John Lethlean, you might be surprised to know that many food bloggers are spending their own hard earned money on paying for their own meals. Food bloggers then share their finds for free via instagram, twitter, facebook and their blogs which in essence is promoting the restaurants and cafes they've dined at. A majority of my own personal disposable income goes towards spending it on food and I can't claim that back like you can and all the other food critics that get paid to eat out. If you're out in a nice restaurant and paying say a $300 bill out of your own money but then claiming it back the next day from your employer then you're not actually paying with your own money, you've just received a free meal and you're being sponsored by your employer. You are personally eating for free and technically getting freebies. That's how I see it. Unless of course you're a financial partner in the company and then you'd be footing for the expenses in the end.\n\nOh and 'I started taking photos a long time before the food blogger ever emerged.' Not quite sure of the relevance of stating this in the article besides trying to allude to saying you were like the inventor of taking photos of your food with a camera? I started taking photos of my food long before I even knew what food blogging was and I'm sure every person that has ever travelled overseas with a camera has taken photos at one time or another of some interesting dish to show their friends and family back home and they're not food bloggers.\n\nAlso booking under a different name seems a bit unnecessary and flawed since once you walk in the door any high profile restaurant will know who you are by now. Or perhaps they don't so really there's no need to actually change your name because they don't know about you anyway. Even if you booked with your own name doesn't mean you'll actually get special treatment. When a restaurant is busy you'll notice any squeaky wheels and how they operate within minutes. I've dined at places with the owners sitting at the table and we've received bad service. It just highlights where improvements need to be made and sometimes things simply can't be hidden even if they know you're a food critic like yourself. \n\nI've always booked under my own name. But perhaps I should start booking it under John Lethlean, Terry Durack, Pat Nourse or Myffy Rigby and see what happens when I arrive. Might be quite funny or maybe they'd just think I have the same name as these food critics or actually wouldn't know who they are anyway.","http://www.news.com.au/lifestyle/food/aussie-food-critics-hit-back-at-claims-their-reviews-arent-independent/story-fn93ypt9-1227145109772","https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152634510243533","Sydney Food Bloggers"],[null,"December 05, 2014 at 01:47PM","Cath Chen","Teaching a class at a gym around Redfern tonight, can anyone recommend places for a takeaway bite around Redfern station on the way home?

She would attend all sorts of food events, following certain chefs from one restaurant to the next. She would even deliver a folder on herself to the head chef. In the folder was a sort of resume showcasing her fandom as a foodie, or a groupie.

Add your own or share.\n\nContradictions in media:\n\nHow is it possible that the Australian restaurant industry is promoted to be excellent and among the best in the world; when the average restaurant score in food guides across Australia taken from hundreds of restaurant evaluations is 13/20. Who would be happy if their children averaged 65% in a final year test?\n\nWhy do the public believe restaurant reviews will always reflect the quality of a restaurant experience?\n\nHow is it possible to be the “The best restaurant ““The best chef” “The best recipe”\n\nWhy do many people believe pictures of food in magazine or on menus come straight from the pot to the plate, without extreme sprucing?\n\nContradictions in awards:\n\nHow can restaurant reviewers assess a restaurant purely on their experience of a single meal without ever considering attitudes, consistency, reliability, dress standards, hygiene, commercial success, and more?\n\nHow is it that chefs who are cited with “A Chefs Hat”, are not willing to wear one as a symbolic image of their vocation and award?\n\nHow is it that many of the very people who call for the abolition of penalty rates do not work on weekends?\n\nContradictions with cooks and chefs:\n\nHow is it possible to be an apprentice chef, when chef is a position of responsibility, whilst an apprentice is learning to cook and moreover graduates with a cookery qualification?\n\nHow can one be a “qualified chef” when a “chef” describes a person’s authority and “cook” identifies their expertise?\n\nHow is possible that chefs believe they are professionals, yet many attend functions looking like rag dolls with unironed clothes and dirty shoes, while supposedly being trained in grooming and hygiene.\n\nHow is it that a cooks/ chef’s occupation is viewed as fascinating, full of excitement, and adventure, yet they prepare the same dish, hour in hour out, day in day out and often year in year out.\n\nWhy are the majority of great chefs not good at marketing themselves, but very skilled at cooking, while the majority of celebrity chefs are not good at cooking but very skilled at marketing.\n\nHow is it possible to train to be a qualified cook while being a vegetarian? \n\nWhy do people who believe a chefs job is only a practical one, and does not require a well-educated person, not aware the chefs cost menu, write memos, and need to understand legalisation.\n\nWhy do the media believe that every chef is an “Executive chef “without questioning their real role experience and responsibility?\n\nHow is it that one can be “The Chef of the year”, when only assessed on one day in clinical competition conditions? \n\nHow can it be that many cooks spoil the broth, when we have only chefs in the industry?\n\nContradictions and menus:\n\nWhy do we have light meals on menus offering deep fried fish and chips?\n\nHow is it that decades ago, we understood that cookery is, and always will be an ever-changing industry; but we still roast chickens, boil spaghetti, grill steaks, and bake ?\n\nHow many chefs who strongly support the environment do not check to see if the seafood they buy is on the endangered list?\n\nContradictions in food recently seen in local shops (LOL):\n\nHow can one sell a chicken sausage schnitzel? \n\nHow can one advertise a chicken strudel that is even also made with puff pastry?\n\n If it is historically stated that that a chefs hat contains 100 pleats to indicate their skill by showing the number of ways they can cook an egg. Does mean chefs do not wear a hat, cannot cook an egg.","https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152656935288533","https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152656935288533","Sydney Food Bloggers"],[null,"December 15, 2014 at 02:24PM","Angela Bee","If anyone is interested in helping building a platform for bloggers to receive relevant and targeted content, come along tomorrow at 6pm to discuss!!!","https://www.facebook.com/events/746843272072229/","https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152657185388533","Sydney Food Bloggers"],[null,"December 15, 2014 at 02:33PM","Gaby Mora",null,"https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152657196223533","https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152657196223533","Sydney Food Bloggers"],[null,"December 15, 2014 at 02:33PM","Gaby Mora",null,"https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152657196223533","https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152657196223533","Sydney Food Bloggers"],[null,"December 15, 2014 at 05:56PM","Matthew Ho","It was really good to get out of the city and to the country side.

Add your own or share.\n\nContradictions in media:\n\nHow is it possible that the Australian restaurant industry is promoted to be excellent and among the best in the world; when the average restaurant score in food guides across Australia taken from hundreds of restaurant evaluations is 13/20. Who would be happy if their children averaged 65% in a final year test?\n\nWhy do the public believe restaurant reviews will always reflect the quality of a restaurant experience?\n\nHow is it possible to be the “The best restaurant ““The best chef” “The best recipe”\n\nWhy do many people believe pictures of food in magazine or on menus come straight from the pot to the plate, without extreme sprucing?\n\nContradictions in awards:\n\nHow can restaurant reviewers assess a restaurant purely on their experience of a single meal without ever considering attitudes, consistency, reliability, dress standards, hygiene, commercial success, and more?\n\nHow is it that chefs who are cited with “A Chefs Hat”, are not willing to wear one as a symbolic image of their vocation and award?\n\nHow is it that many of the very people who call for the abolition of penalty rates do not work on weekends?\n\nContradictions with cooks and chefs:\n\nHow is it possible to be an apprentice chef, when chef is a position of responsibility, whilst an apprentice is learning to cook and moreover graduates with a cookery qualification?\n\nHow can one be a “qualified chef” when a “chef” describes a person’s authority and “cook” identifies their expertise?\n\nHow is possible that chefs believe they are professionals, yet many attend functions looking like rag dolls with unironed clothes and dirty shoes, while supposedly being trained in grooming and hygiene.\n\nHow is it that a cooks/ chef’s occupation is viewed as fascinating, full of excitement, and adventure, yet they prepare the same dish, hour in hour out, day in day out and often year in year out.\n\nWhy are the majority of great chefs not good at marketing themselves, but very skilled at cooking, while the majority of celebrity chefs are not good at cooking but very skilled at marketing.\n\nHow is it possible to train to be a qualified cook while being a vegetarian? \n\nWhy do people who believe a chefs job is only a practical one, and does not require a well-educated person, not aware the chefs cost menu, write memos, and need to understand legalisation.\n\nWhy do the media believe that every chef is an “Executive chef “without questioning their real role experience and responsibility?\n\nHow is it that one can be “The Chef of the year”, when only assessed on one day in clinical competition conditions? \n\nHow can it be that many cooks spoil the broth, when we have only chefs in the industry?\n\nContradictions and menus:\n\nWhy do we have light meals on menus offering deep fried fish and chips?\n\nHow is it that decades ago, we understood that cookery is, and always will be an ever-changing industry; but we still roast chickens, boil spaghetti, grill steaks, and bake ?\n\nHow many chefs who strongly support the environment do not check to see if the seafood they buy is on the endangered list?\n\nContradictions in food recently seen in local shops (LOL):\n\nHow can one sell a chicken sausage schnitzel? \n\nHow can one advertise a chicken strudel that is even also made with puff pastry?\n\n If it is historically stated that that a chefs hat contains 100 pleats to indicate their skill by showing the number of ways they can cook an egg. Does mean chefs do not wear a hat, cannot cook an egg.","https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152656935288533","https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152656935288533","Sydney Food Bloggers"],[null,"December 15, 2014 at 08:54AM","Cath Chen",null,"https://www.facebook.com/confessionsofaglutton/photos/a.663355367092855.1073741825.351203911641337/746094628818928/?type=1","https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152656684288533","Sydney Food Bloggers"],[null,"December 15, 2014 at 08:42AM","Bianca Squadrito","One of the best pizza's I've had the pleasure of eating in Sydney. http://forfoodssake.net/2014/12/15/da-orazio-pizza-porchetta-bondi/","http://forfoodssake.net/2014/12/15/da-orazio-pizza-porchetta-bondi/","https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152656660283533","Sydney Food Bloggers"],[null,"December 15, 2014 at 12:52AM","Bob Wong","I can already see Johnny  #saltedcaramelbananasplitgasming at Daisy's Milkbar","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10154947985530383&set=gm.10152655900523533&type=1&relevant_count=1","https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152655900523533","Sydney Food Bloggers"],[null,"December 15, 2014 at 12:48AM","Bob Wong","InterContinental Sydney Double Bay  Stillery The level 2 bar does deep fried chicken skin and no, not the stuff you get pre fried from thai convience stores.

Quite possibly its just been a natural progression that your account has attracted so many spammy accounts but lets be honest if you've lost an excessive amount of followers then more than likely you've actually just bought those fake followers to make your account look way more influential than it really is and haven't bothered allowing the time for your following to grow organically. \n\nOf course one would never ever admit such underhanded dealings to their real audience and only those who actually have bought fake followers will truly know how they managed to loose so many followers overnight when the #instapurge of Dec 2014 happened. This of course won't stop them from now buying fake followers again before too many of their real followers notice and start thinking 'wow, how on earth did you just loose so many followers, that's strange'. But in the end it really doesn't matter if you buy fake followers again to make your account look the way it was before because your engagement will still remain very low and this will always stand out as a red flag to those who really want to work out your true instagram influencer worthiness. \n\n'Likes' can be bought as well and generally I've noticed if you see an account which gets lots of likes for posts but there's actually hardly any follower comment engagement or referral comments then there's a strong possibility they have their likes paid for as well. My advise is just let your following grow organically and be true to yourself. Work on your instagram and put in the effort and passion that it deserves and hopefully your real followers will help you to grow and achieve the influential status that you desire in time.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10153442261436531&set=gm.10152666949203533&type=1&relevant_count=1","https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152666949203533","Sydney Food Bloggers"],[null,"December 19, 2014 at 02:48AM","Chris Singh","lol instagram","https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152664108028533","https://www.facebook.com/38028323532/posts/10152664108028533","Sydney Food Bloggers"],[null,"December 19, 2014 at 07:06PM","Sara McCleary","Chocolate Cheesecake + Deep Roasted Almond Praline Ice Cream\nEasy to make & completely addictive.

The events are great fun, where you can be as artistic and energetic as you choose - plus it's a great opportunity to make some awesome new vegan friends!  Is there any reason not to go!?\n\nWe'll meet together first for a delicious vegan meal at Hari's restaurant on Broadway (157 Broadway, Ultimo) at 6:30pm.  They have a good and inexpensive range of vegan salads, curries, chai teas and cakes.  (A meal can be <$10). \n\nWhen Hari's run out of vegan cake (probably very soon) we'll split into small teams of 2-4 and chalk through Ultimo and Pyrmont heading towards the Fairfax and Google areas.  Once we're done, there'll no doubt be a few of us seeking a few refreshments at a Pyrmont bar.\n\nWhat to know - It's legal to write messages in chalk on public pavements and there's no intention at all to target any private property or personal belongings.  It's solely to raise awareness peacefully to the mainstream that veganism is viable, sustainable and a positive step for human health, the environment and animal welfare.\n\nSo, Hari's - Wed 3 December.  6:30pm.  \n\n- chalk will be provided and some posters and tape if you prefer postering.\n\n- you have to bring your own enthusiasm and positive vibes, or borrow some from the regular team of chalkers who have oodles of it!  \n\nBe there or miss out!

Without even consulting me they ordered a bunch of meat based dishes for the table... I piped up and said I was vegan and ordered a tofu dish. That and the rice were the only things I could eat on the table, but everyone else had some of the tofu too as well as the beef, duck, fish and chicken dishes.

The events are great fun, where you can be as artistic and energetic as you choose - plus it's a great opportunity to make some awesome new vegan friends!  Is there any reason not to go!?\n\nWe'll meet together first for a delicious vegan meal at Hari's restaurant on Broadway (157 Broadway, Ultimo) at 6:30pm.  They have a good and inexpensive range of vegan salads, curries, chai teas and cakes.  (A meal can be <$10). \n\nWhen Hari's run out of vegan cake (probably very soon) we'll split into small teams of 2-4 and chalk through Ultimo and Pyrmont heading towards the Fairfax and Google areas.  Once we're done, there'll no doubt be a few of us seeking a few refreshments at a Pyrmont bar.\n\nWhat to know - It's legal to write messages in chalk on public pavements and there's no intention at all to target any private property or personal belongings.  It's solely to raise awareness peacefully to the mainstream that veganism is viable, sustainable and a positive step for human health, the environment and animal welfare.\n\nSo, Hari's - Wed 3 December.  6:30pm.  \n\n- chalk will be provided and some posters and tape if you prefer postering.\n\n- you have to bring your own enthusiasm and positive vibes, or borrow some from the regular team of chalkers who have oodles of it!  \n\nBe there or miss out!

When the bill came, they split it equally between all of us even though I only had 2 tiny bowls of rice and tofu. (even the spring rolls were DUCK!)  I paid of course and didn't fuss..... but it's a little unfair don't you think? What do you do/feel in this situation!? How do you handle it? xxxx Lucy \nPs... Katy ROCKS.

So I asked a question the other day regarding family functions and eating meat with your family (how to overcome this pressure etc.) WELL GUESS WHAT I did it!! \nSome of my cousins visited yesterday and we rounded up the family for a dinner. My dad makes his famous 'muscle soup' and when I said 'dad I don't eat meat' he was like 'but muscles aren't meat!' And my cousins got in to an irritatingly loud discussion about how they could NEEVER give us seafood. \nEarlier that day my step mother helped me prepare marinated tofu along with heaps of vegan salads, which was really nice of her. Everything are everything which I really liked. \nThe only thing that reeeeeally got to me was that one of my older cousins was putting a bowl of prawns on the table and me, being the only person not eating them, walked past our end of the table and said 'is anyone eating prawns down here or are you all vegan now?' And like, what?

This superb documentary has touched countless people. Reading through the responses on the ABC2 Facebook page, I couldn't help but notice the outpouring of emotion. There has never been a time in existence when people have been more concerned for animal rights. With this in mind, I would love for ABC2 to air, 'Earthlings.' This quality production is narrated by Academy Award nominated actor, Joaquin Phoenix. He has said of this documentary, 'Of all the films I have ever made, this is the one that gets people talking the most.'\n\nThe documentary shows the reality of the different ways humans use their fellow Earthlings. It's confronting. It's the truth. It would be the perfect documentary to air on your 'Sunday Best' documentary series.\"\n\nI've just received this reply:\n\n\"Dear Michael\n\nThank you for your comments regarding Blackfish, and for your request for the program Earthlings. I will forward your email to the Television Programming Department so that they are made aware of your interest.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nMatthew Galvin\nABC Audience and Consumer Affairs\"\n\nApologies for the lengthy post, but I think that now we are (slightly) on their radar, perhaps more requests for Earthlings may help build some momentum.\n\nHere's the form I contacted them via:\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/contact/contactabc.htm\n\nJust select, 'ABC Audience & Consumer Affairs,' from the drop down menu.

So I asked a question the other day regarding family functions and eating meat with your family (how to overcome this pressure etc.) WELL GUESS WHAT I did it!! \nSome of my cousins visited yesterday and we rounded up the family for a dinner. My dad makes his famous 'muscle soup' and when I said 'dad I don't eat meat' he was like 'but muscles aren't meat!' And my cousins got in to an irritatingly loud discussion about how they could NEEVER give us seafood. \nEarlier that day my step mother helped me prepare marinated tofu along with heaps of vegan salads, which was really nice of her. Everything are everything which I really liked. \nThe only thing that reeeeeally got to me was that one of my older cousins was putting a bowl of prawns on the table and me, being the only person not eating them, walked past our end of the table and said 'is anyone eating prawns down here or are you all vegan now?' And like, what? Just what? \nI never realised how much awkwardness and discrimination you receive from NOT EATING MEAT. \nWhat is wrong with the world!?\n\nDespite the few awkward questions and moments it actually went well and I feel really good about my choices. \n\nThank you for all the support :)","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/780262342035445","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/780262342035445","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 23, 2014 at 06:40AM","Jessica Gauci","So for those like myself that were completely oblivious before watching 'Cowspiracy', organisations like Greenpeace are avoiding addressing the biggest cause of environmental destruction of all - animal agriculture.

This superb documentary has touched countless people. Reading through the responses on the ABC2 Facebook page, I couldn't help but notice the outpouring of emotion. There has never been a time in existence when people have been more concerned for animal rights. With this in mind, I would love for ABC2 to air, 'Earthlings.' This quality production is narrated by Academy Award nominated actor, Joaquin Phoenix. He has said of this documentary, 'Of all the films I have ever made, this is the one that gets people talking the most.'\n\nThe documentary shows the reality of the different ways humans use their fellow Earthlings. It's confronting. It's the truth. It would be the perfect documentary to air on your 'Sunday Best' documentary series.\"\n\nI've just received this reply:\n\n\"Dear Michael\n\nThank you for your comments regarding Blackfish, and for your request for the program Earthlings. I will forward your email to the Television Programming Department so that they are made aware of your interest.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nMatthew Galvin\nABC Audience and Consumer Affairs\"\n\nApologies for the lengthy post, but I think that now we are (slightly) on their radar, perhaps more requests for Earthlings may help build some momentum.\n\nHere's the form I contacted them via:\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/contact/contactabc.htm\n\nJust select, 'ABC Audience & Consumer Affairs,' from the drop down menu.

Vegans might find this a very difficult time as family and friends often question our lifestyle choice, and this is worse if we are surrounded by a group of people (not just one individual) who do not share our ideas and the lack of other vegans to support us. Often, other people get drawn in when one person picks on someone who is perceived as “different”.\nOne of the things you might encounter, is people asking difficult questions. Some good advice on how to deal with this can be found on http://www.veganvalues.org/when_question.htm . It is useful to recognise the type of question that is being asked: is it a genuine request for information or is it a way to discredit your lifestyle choices? Be aware what the other person is trying to do and also be aware of your reactions. You don't have to get drawn into arguments like these, you don't have to justify your choices. The article referred to above suggests that you can answer the question you would LIKE them to ask instead of the question they DID ask. You also have the option to say to people that you are happy to discuss the topic at another time (especially if you are asked questions at an appropriate time). \nIf you are concerned about what's ahead, try and work out how you will cope, but try not to stress out about it too much. \nOf course, another problem with Christmas parties is that, very often, there is a large amount of meat/dairy and this can be very confronting.\nA good option might be to catch up with vegan friends around this time of year or to be able to contact a like-minded person (or to vent in a safe forum such as this group :) ) if you feel overwhelmed in a difficult situation. It is important to remember that you are not alone and you are vegan because it is the right thing to do – no matter how people question this choice. Also, seeing people's reactions for what they are, just a way of reducing any inner tension they might feel because they eat meat (not necessarily because they want to make us feel bad), can help us understand why this is happening.\nBut, of course, try and make the most out of it and treat yourself with some nice vegan food and a nice cruelty-free gift to yourself!","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=762861513786032&set=gm.780394498688896&type=1&relevant_count=1","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/780394498688896","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 23, 2014 at 03:38PM","James Aspey","I heard Thrivefest was epic! \n\nCheers Kym for organising!\n\nMy deepest thank you to Amy and Tanya for promoting Voiceless365 on my behalf and for being all round shining examples of beautiful, vegan women! ✌️❤️","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152822777459462&set=gm.780387198689626&type=1&relevant_count=1","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/780387198689626","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 23, 2014 at 04:10PM","Jacqui Pyke","Loving the debate in my page today?!!!

My uncle also suggested a similar concept last night as a good way to voice the vegan demand. So when I just grabbed a coffee I asked if any of their amazing looking sweets were vegan (knowing they aren't). I had to elaborate to dairy & egg free, alas they were only gluten free (totally comparable) but had a chat with the lovely person serving and it might be a small vegan seed that cafe otherwise wouldn't have.

Thanks in advance :)\n\nhttps://m.facebook.com/WIRES.wildlife.rescue/photos/a.406111659749.196525.164290389749/10152953212474750/?type=1","https://www.facebook.com/WIRES.wildlife.rescue/photos/a.406111659749.196525.164290389749/10152953212474750/?type=1","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/780328055362207","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 23, 2014 at 09:29PM","Louisa Moses","Replace the butter ... and YUM!\nhttp://organised.hsw.com.au/articles/roasted-slinky-rosemary-potatoes-with-sea-salt/","http://organised.hsw.com.au/articles/roasted-slinky-rosemary-potatoes-with-sea-salt/","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/780477965347216","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 23, 2014 at 01:38PM","Anna Burr","Nice sunny day for a chalk along the river ✌️","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152801224105306&set=pcb.780349588693387&type=1&relevant_count=4","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/780349588693387","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 23, 2014 at 11:44AM","Anna Greer","So hot today!

This superb documentary has touched countless people. Reading through the responses on the ABC2 Facebook page, I couldn't help but notice the outpouring of emotion. There has never been a time in existence when people have been more concerned for animal rights. With this in mind, I would love for ABC2 to air, 'Earthlings.' This quality production is narrated by Academy Award nominated actor, Joaquin Phoenix. He has said of this documentary, 'Of all the films I have ever made, this is the one that gets people talking the most.'\n\nThe documentary shows the reality of the different ways humans use their fellow Earthlings. It's confronting. It's the truth. It would be the perfect documentary to air on your 'Sunday Best' documentary series.\"\n\nI've just received this reply:\n\n\"Dear Michael\n\nThank you for your comments regarding Blackfish, and for your request for the program Earthlings. I will forward your email to the Television Programming Department so that they are made aware of your interest.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nMatthew Galvin\nABC Audience and Consumer Affairs\"\n\nApologies for the lengthy post, but I think that now we are (slightly) on their radar, perhaps more requests for Earthlings may help build some momentum.\n\nHere's the form I contacted them via:\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/contact/contactabc.htm\n\nJust select, 'ABC Audience & Consumer Affairs,' from the drop down menu. In the program field, I put 'Sunday Best.'\n\nWe can do this :)","http://www.abc.net.au/contact/contactabc.htm","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/780289485366064","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 23, 2014 at 12:21PM","Andrea Alese Buckman","My mum just sent me a link to a video on fb of a man yelling 'bacon' at scared little piggies.

My uncle also suggested a similar concept last night as a good way to voice the vegan demand. So when I just grabbed a coffee I asked if any of their amazing looking sweets were vegan (knowing they aren't). I had to elaborate to dairy & egg free, alas they were only gluten free (totally comparable) but had a chat with the lovely person serving and it might be a small vegan seed that cafe otherwise wouldn't have.

So I asked a question the other day regarding family functions and eating meat with your family (how to overcome this pressure etc.) WELL GUESS WHAT I did it!! \nSome of my cousins visited yesterday and we rounded up the family for a dinner. My dad makes his famous 'muscle soup' and when I said 'dad I don't eat meat' he was like 'but muscles aren't meat!' And my cousins got in to an irritatingly loud discussion about how they could NEEVER give us seafood. \nEarlier that day my step mother helped me prepare marinated tofu along with heaps of vegan salads, which was really nice of her. Everything are everything which I really liked. \nThe only thing that reeeeeally got to me was that one of my older cousins was putting a bowl of prawns on the table and me, being the only person not eating them, walked past our end of the table and said 'is anyone eating prawns down here or are you all vegan now?' And like, what? Just what? \nI never realised how much awkwardness and discrimination you receive from NOT EATING MEAT. \nWhat is wrong with the world!?\n\nDespite the few awkward questions and moments it actually went well and I feel really good about my choices. \n\nThank you for all the support :)","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/780262342035445","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/780262342035445","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 23, 2014 at 05:11PM","Donna Misanthropist Winterbottom","Do you love Bounty Burgers?

But what if taking a mass approach isn't most effective. Veganism is still niche. It's also asking people to make big behavioural changes. Changing behaviour is one of the hardest things to do.  It's also changing values and believes that people have been raised with and are at the chore of who people are and how they identify themselves. What if we really targeted our approach? Identified groups of people who are easiest to change opinions based on their current behaviours and attitudes? Those people more open to change. For example, those already with some strong attitudes towards animal welfare or those concerned about health or the environment (very top level but we could delve deeper to get better insight into those people) Rather than the masses. Our efforts will be better received and more likely to make an impact. The effort vs reward will be greater (consumer segmentation 101).

This superb documentary has touched countless people. Reading through the responses on the ABC2 Facebook page, I couldn't help but notice the outpouring of emotion. There has never been a time in existence when people have been more concerned for animal rights. With this in mind, I would love for ABC2 to air, 'Earthlings.' This quality production is narrated by Academy Award nominated actor, Joaquin Phoenix. He has said of this documentary, 'Of all the films I have ever made, this is the one that gets people talking the most.'\n\nThe documentary shows the reality of the different ways humans use their fellow Earthlings. It's confronting. It's the truth. It would be the perfect documentary to air on your 'Sunday Best' documentary series.\"\n\nI've just received this reply:\n\n\"Dear Michael\n\nThank you for your comments regarding Blackfish, and for your request for the program Earthlings. I will forward your email to the Television Programming Department so that they are made aware of your interest.\n\nYours sincerely\n\nMatthew Galvin\nABC Audience and Consumer Affairs\"\n\nApologies for the lengthy post, but I think that now we are (slightly) on their radar, perhaps more requests for Earthlings may help build some momentum.\n\nHere's the form I contacted them via:\nhttp://www.abc.net.au/contact/contactabc.htm\n\nJust select, 'ABC Audience & Consumer Affairs,' from the drop down menu.

I corrected and and said no actually it's again for animal agriculture, she said that its all a load of rubbish and that all my statistics are untrue blah blah blah I pleaded with her to watch cowspiracy I said I would pay for it if she'd please watch it and she outright said no and she still kept talking over the top of me and hung up.","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/780955848632761","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/780955848632761","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 24, 2014 at 06:23PM","Janarthani JD","I just found VMAS salty crispy chicken at my local Asian grocers - yayers!!","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/781048415290171","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/781048415290171","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 24, 2014 at 06:17PM","Jeremy Monforte","Today's troll.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10152512848142549&set=pcb.781046681957011&type=1&relevant_count=5","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/781046681957011","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 24, 2014 at 01:06PM","Jessica Nicole","There’s plenty of food.

But what if taking a mass approach isn't most effective. Veganism is still niche. It's also asking people to make big behavioural changes. Changing behaviour is one of the hardest things to do.  It's also changing values and believes that people have been raised with and are at the chore of who people are and how they identify themselves. What if we really targeted our approach? Identified groups of people who are easiest to change opinions based on their current behaviours and attitudes? Those people more open to change. For example, those already with some strong attitudes towards animal welfare or those concerned about health or the environment (very top level but we could delve deeper to get better insight into those people) Rather than the masses. Our efforts will be better received and more likely to make an impact. The effort vs reward will be greater (consumer segmentation 101). Messages will have greater cut through and greater impact....","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/780449355350077","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/780449355350077","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 25, 2014 at 02:09PM","Jenny Wang","45 minutes later, it's ready to serve!

Before I went vegan but knew I had to (those wasted months while I dragged my feet) I made myself read and watch to help me over the line of breaking a life time of conditioning in what I ate and drank. But once I went vegan I stopped. I felt that I didn’t need to subject myself to the horrors anymore because I wasn’t  part of the system that caused them. I haven’t watched Earthlings and I never will. I know to watch it will break my sanity and for what end?  But yes I would feel guilty- by turning away from these images it felt like I wasn’t fully committed to the cause. Then I found the article below and if I ever feel that guilt creeping up I read it. I esp. like the line about guilt being a wasted energy.

I recently adopted 2 female kittens (6-7 months old) from a stray mother cat who gave birth to them in our backyard. I got the two spayed and whilst one is completely friendly and docile, the other seems to hover from being friendly and then completely scared and aggressive (especially when I wake up in the mornings). It feels like one step forward two steps back with her. \n\nShe has a safe covered spot for when she wants to be away from everything but I don't know if there is any thing else I can be doing to integrate her into the household? I've been keeping them inside as their spaying stitches heal but right now they only have my reasonably sized bedroom to play in (as my roommates have an indoor puppy who is friendly but a little too boisterous). I don't want to have to resort to Feliway unless it's a last resort though. \n\nHope you all are having a great week :)","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/781669581894721","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/781669581894721","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 24, 2014 at 11:03PM","Mark Williamson","A newly-vegan friend is looking for a wallet, he's found a few online but they seem to be pretty expensive apparently!

Before I went vegan but knew I had to (those wasted months while I dragged my feet) I made myself read and watch to help me over the line of breaking a life time of conditioning in what I ate and drank. But once I went vegan I stopped. I felt that I didn’t need to subject myself to the horrors anymore because I wasn’t  part of the system that caused them. I haven’t watched Earthlings and I never will. I know to watch it will break my sanity and for what end?  But yes I would feel guilty- by turning away from these images it felt like I wasn’t fully committed to the cause. Then I found the article below and if I ever feel that guilt creeping up I read it. I esp. like the line about guilt being a wasted energy.

I got the two spayed and whilst one is completely friendly and docile, the other seems to hover from being friendly and then completely scared and aggressive (especially when I wake up in the mornings). It feels like one step forward two steps back with her. \n\nShe has a safe covered spot for when she wants to be away from everything but I don't know if there is any thing else I can be doing to integrate her into the household? I've been keeping them inside as their spaying stitches heal but right now they only have my reasonably sized bedroom to play in (as my roommates have an indoor puppy who is friendly but a little too boisterous).

This ended and then the next day she posted saying a vegan is like a jehovas witness with their blind persistence. \n\nSo naturally i replied with more info on the cruelty and things. People kept writing back so i also kept up with information. Eventually she deleted both posts after i had posted the video by Martin Dingle-wall. Anyway, she then messaged me privately and basically put me down saying I don't listen to reason and that I'm part of a cult, and that i don't respect her because i assume she is ignorant. When it comes to this kind of situation should i have just stopped talking? \n\nI feel saddened because it feels like veganism consumes a lot of my life and that by trying to teach people I am actually just really really annoying. Like who am I to try and teach anyone? I think the approach I used (posting lots of science facts and cruelty info) maybe isn't the best. (but it was never cruel or rude it was always just the information). Maybe i should give up and just write things on pavements in chalk instead. She was telling me i would be lonely if i can't accept that some people won't be vegan, like maybe it is true because i will always be trying to share some kind of information with people, i just can't help it! Does anyone have any advice on what to do with the enthusiasm ? I also feel annoyed sometimes that i found out about veganism because i feel so passionately about it. Am i crazy?

You can watch some of the footage here however I advise against it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_3xwGiB4gs\n\nThe activists that took this footage made it public by putting it on the internet. They did not go to the RSPCA in person because they knew that they would have risked being arrested for taking the footage. However they did give the footage to the RSPCA before making it public.\n\nRSPCA NSW released a statement only a couple of days ago that they have decided to drop ALL charges against Wally’s Piggery. Why? Because they say that the activists who took the footage did not go to the RSPCA first to make their statements in person before making the footage public. How does this make sense you ask? How is this legal? How can they lie to the public like this? How can Wally’s Piggery get off after having been exposed, with clear footage of committing so many incomprehensible acts of cruelty? Isn’t the RSPCA an animal welfare organization? The answer is simple! The RSPCA does NOT care about ‘all creatures great and small’, they care about  ALL DOLLAR BILLS GREAT AND SMALL!\n\nPersonally this whole thing makes me feel so sick and if any of you are just as upset as I am and you want to speak up and let the RSPCA know that what they are doing is not ok, I’m happy to let you know that a group of us are protesting by link bombing the NSW’s fb page right now!! To get involved all you have to do is:\n\n1) go to https://www.facebook.com/RSPCANewSouthWales?fref=ts\n2) simply copy and paste this comment+link as a comment and as a reply to their latest article:  \nRSPCA Approved - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_3xwGiB4gs\n3) click like on the other people’s comments who have shared this link so that our comments stay at the top.\n4) If you want to get involved in future link bombing projects make sure you join the Vegan Link Bombing page.\n\nThank you to everyone who gets involved and speaks up for these pigs.

I recently adopted 2 female kittens (6-7 months old) from a stray mother cat who gave birth to them in our backyard. I got the two spayed and whilst one is completely friendly and docile, the other seems to hover from being friendly and then completely scared and aggressive (especially when I wake up in the mornings). It feels like one step forward two steps back with her. \n\nShe has a safe covered spot for when she wants to be away from everything but I don't know if there is any thing else I can be doing to integrate her into the household? I've been keeping them inside as their spaying stitches heal but right now they only have my reasonably sized bedroom to play in (as my roommates have an indoor puppy who is friendly but a little too boisterous).

If anything, discovering the bleakness of it all is depressing and can create a sense of PTSD, as Claire Mann so wonderfully put it in her article. \nAny thoughts?\nhttps://au.news.yahoo.com/a/25610112/vegetarians-healthy-but-unhappy-study/","https://au.news.yahoo.com/a/25610112/vegetarians-healthy-but-unhappy-study/","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/782040591857620","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 26, 2014 at 07:03PM","Kym V Staton","wots for dinner?","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/782246558503690","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/782246558503690","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 26, 2014 at 08:29PM","Mel Lang","The more I think about it the more I live the idea of a salsher film full of gore and guts based entirely on animal agriculture.

It's been a huge help to sit back and quietly observe all the posts in here, so thank you!\n\nI grew up on a farm, which is why I stopped eating meat as a kid, but I spent a bit of time in small dairies and milked cows and I was always kind of okay with it because the cows weren't subjected to any noticeable trauma (this is small dairies - I'm sure it would be awful on a mass scale. Also, I was a kid haha). Anyway, I never put much thought into what happens to their babies, and now I'm aware, I just can't stomach milk. I was always against gelatine, animal rennet, caged eggs etc and mostly ate vegan if it was accessible, but now I'm going the whole hog...so to speak. \n\nAnyway, I have two questions: \n\n1. Does anyone know of any vegan-accommodating restaurants in Wollongong, apart from Au Lac? Visiting tomorrow and I'm so out of the loop about food down there!\n\n2. What do you guys do about your food being cooked in the same fryers/oils/pans as meat? As a vego I always checked and avoided it and I figured that now I've started asking for strictly vegan options, they would definitely be kept separate, but the response I get when I ask still seems to be that vegan options are still fried in the same oil as meat??\n\nThanks!

But once I went vegan I stopped. I felt that I didn’t need to subject myself to the horrors anymore because I wasn’t  part of the system that caused them. I haven’t watched Earthlings and I never will. I know to watch it will break my sanity and for what end?  But yes I would feel guilty- by turning away from these images it felt like I wasn’t fully committed to the cause. Then I found the article below and if I ever feel that guilt creeping up I read it.

As part of my job, I facilitate groups that focus on forgiveness. Forgiveness is not just something that we need to apply to others, but also to ourselves.\nSome of us feel guilty for what we have done in the past, for using animal products. Most of us made choices that we feel bad about now. However, feelings of guilt affect us not just emotionally, but also physically.\nTo deal with these feelings of guilt, it is necessary to consider what exactly you think you did wrong. Ask yourself: why did I do it? Most of us did not know then what we know now, we didn’t base our actions on the truth we are now aware of. Think about how you would have acted then if you then knew what you know now.\nIt is important to know what exactly you feel guilty about and the reasons you did what you did.\nThere are several ways to deal with these feelings of guilt. You can talk about how you feel to someone who understands you, who is like minded. This way, you will come to understand that you are not alone in this.\nAnother way is to realize that you have changed. Think about how different you are now and how your actions reflect this. What you did is in the past. While we all make mistakes, they don’t define who we are. As we can’t ask forgiveness to those we harmed, we can focus our energy on those that need our help.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=764678096937707&set=gm.782311258497220&type=1&relevant_count=1","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/782311258497220","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 25, 2014 at 04:12PM","Toni Patsias","Hey guys, this might not be the exact right place but I was wondering if any of you had any advice about the behaviour of cats, stray cats in particular. I recently adopted 2 female kittens (6-7 months old) from a stray mother cat who gave birth to them in our backyard. I got the two spayed and whilst one is completely friendly and docile, the other seems to hover from being friendly and then completely scared and aggressive (especially when I wake up in the mornings). It feels like one step forward two steps back with her. \n\nShe has a safe covered spot for when she wants to be away from everything but I don't know if there is any thing else I can be doing to integrate her into the household? I've been keeping them inside as their spaying stitches heal but right now they only have my reasonably sized bedroom to play in (as my roommates have an indoor puppy who is friendly but a little too boisterous). I don't want to have to resort to Feliway unless it's a last resort though. \n\nHope you all are having a great week :)","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/781669581894721","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/781669581894721","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 26, 2014 at 07:41PM","Lisa V Blundell","Anyone tried this?

You can watch some of the footage here however I advise against it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_3xwGiB4gs\n\nThe activists that took this footage made it public by putting it on the internet. They did not go to the RSPCA in person because they knew that they would have risked being arrested for taking the footage. However they did give the footage to the RSPCA before making it public.\n\nRSPCA NSW released a statement only a couple of days ago that they have decided to drop ALL charges against Wally’s Piggery. Why? Because they say that the activists who took the footage did not go to the RSPCA first to make their statements in person before making the footage public. How does this make sense you ask? How is this legal? How can they lie to the public like this? How can Wally’s Piggery get off after having been exposed, with clear footage of committing so many incomprehensible acts of cruelty? Isn’t the RSPCA an animal welfare organization? The answer is simple! The RSPCA does NOT care about ‘all creatures great and small’, they care about  ALL DOLLAR BILLS GREAT AND SMALL!\n\nPersonally this whole thing makes me feel so sick and if any of you are just as upset as I am and you want to speak up and let the RSPCA know that what they are doing is not ok, I’m happy to let you know that a group of us are protesting by link bombing the NSW’s fb page right now!!

There are wild plum trees for us to freely forage from 🍒 We ask for those attending to bring an item of food along for everyone to share - it could be something purchased or a vegan home-made dish. It will be good to bring a picnic blanket along for yourself and perhaps some cutlery and plates. 🍴\n\nThis is also an off-lead dog park so bringing your fury family members is encouraged 🐾\n\nFor those of you with children, there is a play park they can play at 👶 \n\nThere is plenty of street parking 🚗 You can find parking on West Street, Wentworth Street, Brighton Street, Station Street and Park Street. The park is also a short walk from Petersham or Lewisham Station (Lewisham is a tad closer). \n\nIf you wish to attend, please RSVP by clicking the link > http://goo.gl/CbwZ2q\n\nI hope to see you all there! :) \n\n🌞🌳🍒🐾","http://goo.gl/CbwZ2q","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/782768898451456","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 27, 2014 at 03:50PM","Teresa Romanovsky","Very disappointed.

We have jointly decided to decline your function booking.\nRegards\nMichael Wiggins\nRoyal Exhibition Hotel\n\nWTF?

I'm expecting over 50 people who will spend BIG on booze, they would have netted thousands of dollars.  I just don't understand, they have these items available anyway but they just want to force me into paying extra because it's labelled vegan and when I question them they back away as it's obviously all just too hard to make food with vegetables!!!!\n\nIf anyone can recommend a venue that will accommodate 50 people, allow a DJ and will provide vegan food and wine then please let me know!","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/782764711785208","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/782764711785208","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 27, 2014 at 03:51PM","Andrea Alese Buckman","What is the most unexpected benefit of regularly chalking earthlings.com all over Sydney??

This ended and then the next day she posted saying a vegan is like a jehovas witness with their blind persistence. \n\nSo naturally i replied with more info on the cruelty and things. People kept writing back so i also kept up with information. Eventually she deleted both posts after i had posted the video by Martin Dingle-wall. Anyway, she then messaged me privately and basically put me down saying I don't listen to reason and that I'm part of a cult, and that i don't respect her because i assume she is ignorant.

Like who am I to try and teach anyone? I think the approach I used (posting lots of science facts and cruelty info) maybe isn't the best. (but it was never cruel or rude it was always just the information). Maybe i should give up and just write things on pavements in chalk instead.

You can watch some of the footage here however I advise against it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_3xwGiB4gs\n\nThe activists that took this footage made it public by putting it on the internet. They did not go to the RSPCA in person because they knew that they would have risked being arrested for taking the footage. However they did give the footage to the RSPCA before making it public.\n\nRSPCA NSW released a statement only a couple of days ago that they have decided to drop ALL charges against Wally’s Piggery. Why? Because they say that the activists who took the footage did not go to the RSPCA first to make their statements in person before making the footage public. How does this make sense you ask? How is this legal? How can they lie to the public like this? How can Wally’s Piggery get off after having been exposed, with clear footage of committing so many incomprehensible acts of cruelty? Isn’t the RSPCA an animal welfare organization? The answer is simple! The RSPCA does NOT care about ‘all creatures great and small’, they care about  ALL DOLLAR BILLS GREAT AND SMALL!\n\nPersonally this whole thing makes me feel so sick and if any of you are just as upset as I am and you want to speak up and let the RSPCA know that what they are doing is not ok, I’m happy to let you know that a group of us are protesting by link bombing the NSW’s fb page right now!! To get involved all you have to do is:\n\n1) go to https://www.facebook.com/RSPCANewSouthWales?fref=ts\n2) simply copy and paste this comment+link as a comment and as a reply to their latest article:  \nRSPCA Approved - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n_3xwGiB4gs\n3) click like on the other people’s comments who have shared this link so that our comments stay at the top.\n4) If you want to get involved in future link bombing projects make sure you join the Vegan Link Bombing page.\n\nThank you to everyone who gets involved and speaks up for these pigs.

As part of my job, I facilitate groups that focus on forgiveness. Forgiveness is not just something that we need to apply to others, but also to ourselves.\nSome of us feel guilty for what we have done in the past, for using animal products. Most of us made choices that we feel bad about now. However, feelings of guilt affect us not just emotionally, but also physically.\nTo deal with these feelings of guilt, it is necessary to consider what exactly you think you did wrong. Ask yourself: why did I do it? Most of us did not know then what we know now, we didn’t base our actions on the truth we are now aware of. Think about how you would have acted then if you then knew what you know now.\nIt is important to know what exactly you feel guilty about and the reasons you did what you did.\nThere are several ways to deal with these feelings of guilt. You can talk about how you feel to someone who understands you, who is like minded. This way, you will come to understand that you are not alone in this.\nAnother way is to realize that you have changed. Think about how different you are now and how your actions reflect this. What you did is in the past. While we all make mistakes, they don’t define who we are. As we can’t ask forgiveness to those we harmed, we can focus our energy on those that need our help.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=764678096937707&set=gm.782311258497220&type=1&relevant_count=1","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/782311258497220","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 26, 2014 at 09:08PM","Jacqui Pyke","Mink eye lash extensions.  is it really a thing?\nhttp://www.groupon.com.au/deals/sydney/taren-point-massage-beauty-2/719346598?p=1&nlp=&CID=AU_CRM_1_0_0_329&a=715827892&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&sid=f6c027a4-b487-4fb9-b552-1ac2faf8bc74&division=sydney&uh=71891103-ab2c-45c5-8f9a-158fa1d353c8&date=20142511&sender=rm&s=body&c=deal_button&d=deal-page&utm_campaign=taren-point-massage-beauty-2-719346598","http://www.groupon.com.au/deals/sydney/taren-point-massage-beauty-2/719346598?p=1&nlp=&CID=AU_CRM_1_0_0_329&a=715827892&utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&sid=f6c027a4-b487-4fb9-b552-1ac2faf8bc74&division=sydney&uh=71891103-ab2c-45c5-8f9a-158fa1d353c8&date=20142511&sender=rm&s=body&c=deal_button&d=deal-page&utm_campaign=taren-point-massage-beauty-2-719346598","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/782311178497228","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 26, 2014 at 09:30PM","Andrew Kellett","My first juice with my magic bullet. \nWatermelon, yep that's it...\nI'm such a beginner.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10205804025406151&set=gm.782316441830035&type=1&relevant_count=1","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/782316441830035","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 26, 2014 at 11:40PM","Ed Heine","This guy's a legend!

It's been a huge help to sit back and quietly observe all the posts in here, so thank you!\n\nI grew up on a farm, which is why I stopped eating meat as a kid, but I spent a bit of time in small dairies and milked cows and I was always kind of okay with it because the cows weren't subjected to any noticeable trauma (this is small dairies - I'm sure it would be awful on a mass scale. Also, I was a kid haha). Anyway, I never put much thought into what happens to their babies, and now I'm aware, I just can't stomach milk. I was always against gelatine, animal rennet, caged eggs etc and mostly ate vegan if it was accessible, but now I'm going the whole hog...so to speak. \n\nAnyway, I have two questions: \n\n1. Does anyone know of any vegan-accommodating restaurants in Wollongong, apart from Au Lac? Visiting tomorrow and I'm so out of the loop about food down there!\n\n2. What do you guys do about your food being cooked in the same fryers/oils/pans as meat? As a vego I always checked and avoided it and I figured that now I've started asking for strictly vegan options, they would definitely be kept separate, but the response I get when I ask still seems to be that vegan options are still fried in the same oil as meat??\n\nThanks!

This ended and then the next day she posted saying a vegan is like a jehovas witness with their blind persistence. \n\nSo naturally i replied with more info on the cruelty and things. People kept writing back so i also kept up with information. Eventually she deleted both posts after i had posted the video by Martin Dingle-wall. Anyway, she then messaged me privately and basically put me down saying I don't listen to reason and that I'm part of a cult, and that i don't respect her because i assume she is ignorant. When it comes to this kind of situation should i have just stopped talking? \n\nI feel saddened because it feels like veganism consumes a lot of my life and that by trying to teach people I am actually just really really annoying. Like who am I to try and teach anyone? I think the approach I used (posting lots of science facts and cruelty info) maybe isn't the best. (but it was never cruel or rude it was always just the information). Maybe i should give up and just write things on pavements in chalk instead. She was telling me i would be lonely if i can't accept that some people won't be vegan, like maybe it is true because i will always be trying to share some kind of information with people, i just can't help it! Does anyone have any advice on what to do with the enthusiasm ? I also feel annoyed sometimes that i found out about veganism because i feel so passionately about it. Am i crazy? Does anyone else feel this way?

All going really well, he's been really accommodating until today when I questioned a couple of the food items that are on their regular menu and happen to be vegan anyway but they quoted me an extra dollar per piece.  This is the response I received:\n\nHi Teresa,\nAfter discussions with our kitchen, whom are a separate business.  We have jointly decided to decline your function booking.\nRegards\nMichael Wiggins\nRoyal Exhibition Hotel\n\nWTF?

As part of my job, I facilitate groups that focus on forgiveness. Forgiveness is not just something that we need to apply to others, but also to ourselves.\nSome of us feel guilty for what we have done in the past, for using animal products. Most of us made choices that we feel bad about now. However, feelings of guilt affect us not just emotionally, but also physically.\nTo deal with these feelings of guilt, it is necessary to consider what exactly you think you did wrong. Ask yourself: why did I do it? Most of us did not know then what we know now, we didn’t base our actions on the truth we are now aware of. Think about how you would have acted then if you then knew what you know now.\nIt is important to know what exactly you feel guilty about and the reasons you did what you did.\nThere are several ways to deal with these feelings of guilt. You can talk about how you feel to someone who understands you, who is like minded. This way, you will come to understand that you are not alone in this.\nAnother way is to realize that you have changed. Think about how different you are now and how your actions reflect this. What you did is in the past. While we all make mistakes, they don’t define who we are. As we can’t ask forgiveness to those we harmed, we can focus our energy on those that need our help.","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=764678096937707&set=gm.782311258497220&type=1&relevant_count=1","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/782311258497220","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"November 27, 2014 at 11:31AM","Kerrie Curran","I had some interesting feedback from a friend who unfriended me because I posted too much stuff about animals.

There are so many fur babies who will be gifted and then quickly dumped in the New Year. So many animals who will be slaughtered for Christmas lunch. So many gifts derived from animal cruelty that will shortly become landfill. \n\nI'm brainstorming how my Christmas can not only have the lowest impact on animals possible, but how it can actually be harnessed to help them. I've asked my friends and family to donate to various animal charities rather than give me gifts. I'm gifting people baskets of delicious homemade vegan treats, and hosting vegan Christmas dinners to show them how delicious and easy it is. I hope I can finally persuade my family not to slaughter an entire farmyard for our lunch, like they usually do. To them its not Christmas unless there's at least 5 different dead animals on our plates to choose from. We really, really don't need entire tables of tortured flesh to celebrate being together. \n\nDoes anyone else have any other ideas on how we can help our animal friends this Christmas?

Do you think I should email them also or wait and see what they say?  -  Hey team H&A. I have been enjoying your show for many years now but I have noticed in recent episodes that some of the characters have been frequently wearing fur and feathers. It has been extensively documented that the fur and feather industries regularly cause a huge amount of suffering and pain to both farmed and wild animals and common practices, within these industries, have been shown to be inhumane and disgraceful. Even faux fur, if not made in Australia, can contain rabbit, cat and dog fur, sometimes sourced from pet animals that are stolen from their homes. I find the use of fur and feathers in your show distressful and I ask that you would please reconsider the use of these materials when making wardrobe choices, I implore you for the animals. Please don't put a compassionless dent on human entertainment and on a show that so many of us enjoy.

One of these people noticed I wasn't eating meat and asked if I was a vegetarian.  My sister all too happy to speak for me blurted, 'no she's actually vegan, so no milk and eggs too ... ' etc.  He looked frustrated, then I could see what was coming ... he then blurted out .. \"I don't believe you're vegan\".  Everyone just went quite and looked at me.  I knew exactly what he wanted to say, so I said it.  I said \"you're confused because you are looking at me thinking that vegan equals skinny, but you see me and you're wondering why i'm not skinny\".  Honestly I've had an extremely crap week and I've been having lots of health issues and knee problems this week, and in the back of my mind I started questioning if me being vegan has anything to do with the weight I've put on since going vegan three years ago.

There are so many fur babies who will be gifted and then quickly dumped in the New Year. So many animals who will be slaughtered for Christmas lunch. So many gifts derived from animal cruelty that will shortly become landfill. \n\nI'm brainstorming how my Christmas can not only have the lowest impact on animals possible, but how it can actually be harnessed to help them. I've asked my friends and family to donate to various animal charities rather than give me gifts. I'm gifting people baskets of delicious homemade vegan treats, and hosting vegan Christmas dinners to show them how delicious and easy it is. I hope I can finally persuade my family not to slaughter an entire farmyard for our lunch, like they usually do. To them its not Christmas unless there's at least 5 different dead animals on our plates to choose from. We really, really don't need entire tables of tortured flesh to celebrate being together. \n\nDoes anyone else have any other ideas on how we can help our animal friends this Christmas?

I work on an island offshore of North Western Australia with 7000 or so others. It's an A class nature reserve with super tight restrictions of what I can bring into the island. Pretty much our whole diet isn't allowed ( unless it's processed which I avoid). All of our food is provided. \nUnfortunately 95% of it is contaminated animal products. They even put bacon in the cabbage and beans then put it in the vegetarian menu labeled as cabbage and bacon. \nOver 8 months of me pointing things like that out. Intentionally requesting special meals off busy chefs. Making head chefs have to walk away from whatever they are doing to get someone to open me a can of kidney beans has paid off. \nThanks to some other mysterious vegans on the island I am yet to meet, we now have a vegan section for lunches. \nNow I fight for a vegan protein source for dinner every night! \n\nI feel bad I irritated busy people just doing their job.

I have been a vegetarian for a few years now but recently I became a vegan as I chose to live a complete cruelty free lifestyle. In my circle of friends and family I have no one who are either vegetarian or vegans, so I'm bit of a loner when it comes to my life choices. The reason why I chose to follow this path and become a vegan is because I don't want to contribute to the pain and suffering of any living beings, I'm very passionate about caring and loving animals and I believe it's the right way to live. A bit about me well I was a former vet nurse/ animal technician (which I saw some horrific things) but due to an injury which I now suffer with chronic pain I had to change fields so now I'm a mental health worker/ youth worker studying social science and psychology. I am also the mummy of 7 beautiful dogs 😍 As I mentioned before I am fairly new at being a vegan so I have so much more to learn and would love to make new friends in the process.

There are so many fur babies who will be gifted and then quickly dumped in the New Year. So many animals who will be slaughtered for Christmas lunch. So many gifts derived from animal cruelty that will shortly become landfill. \n\nI'm brainstorming how my Christmas can not only have the lowest impact on animals possible, but how it can actually be harnessed to help them. I've asked my friends and family to donate to various animal charities rather than give me gifts. I'm gifting people baskets of delicious homemade vegan treats, and hosting vegan Christmas dinners to show them how delicious and easy it is. I hope I can finally persuade my family not to slaughter an entire farmyard for our lunch, like they usually do. To them its not Christmas unless there's at least 5 different dead animals on our plates to choose from. We really, really don't need entire tables of tortured flesh to celebrate being together. \n\nDoes anyone else have any other ideas on how we can help our animal friends this Christmas?

Do you think I should email them also or wait and see what they say?  -  Hey team H&A. I have been enjoying your show for many years now but I have noticed in recent episodes that some of the characters have been frequently wearing fur and feathers. It has been extensively documented that the fur and feather industries regularly cause a huge amount of suffering and pain to both farmed and wild animals and common practices, within these industries, have been shown to be inhumane and disgraceful. Even faux fur, if not made in Australia, can contain rabbit, cat and dog fur, sometimes sourced from pet animals that are stolen from their homes. I find the use of fur and feathers in your show distressful and I ask that you would please reconsider the use of these materials when making wardrobe choices, I implore you for the animals. Please don't put a compassionless dent on human entertainment and on a show that so many of us enjoy.

Do you think I should email them also or wait and see what they say?  -  Hey team H&A. I have been enjoying your show for many years now but I have noticed in recent episodes that some of the characters have been frequently wearing fur and feathers. It has been extensively documented that the fur and feather industries regularly cause a huge amount of suffering and pain to both farmed and wild animals and common practices, within these industries, have been shown to be inhumane and disgraceful. Even faux fur, if not made in Australia, can contain rabbit, cat and dog fur, sometimes sourced from pet animals that are stolen from their homes. I find the use of fur and feathers in your show distressful and I ask that you would please reconsider the use of these materials when making wardrobe choices, I implore you for the animals. Please don't put a compassionless dent on human entertainment and on a show that so many of us enjoy.

I feel like a lot of people around me just revert back to eating meat after the 'shock' wears off. The people in this group are so kind and caring and I feel to a degree that we are more sensitive than most of the people out there in the world. Perhaps trying to use the selling point of vegan health, longer life, healthier hair, better skin, better digestion will cause people to stay vegan for longer or make it more desirable.... as in people will want to do it out of a genuine desire to 'look attractive', longer their life/better their health rather than just shock at the world? I feel like cruelty photos are effective as a trigger.. but a lot of humans are so desensitised these days that the shock wears off after a while or it doesn't shock them at all. Take me for an example, Earthlings shocked me and made me feel pathetic for endorsing the industry....

I have been a vegetarian for a few years now but recently I became a vegan as I chose to live a complete cruelty free lifestyle. In my circle of friends and family I have no one who are either vegetarian or vegans, so I'm bit of a loner when it comes to my life choices. The reason why I chose to follow this path and become a vegan is because I don't want to contribute to the pain and suffering of any living beings, I'm very passionate about caring and loving animals and I believe it's the right way to live. A bit about me well I was a former vet nurse/ animal technician (which I saw some horrific things) but due to an injury which I now suffer with chronic pain I had to change fields so now I'm a mental health worker/ youth worker studying social science and psychology. I am also the mummy of 7 beautiful dogs 😍 As I mentioned before I am fairly new at being a vegan so I have so much more to learn and would love to make new friends in the process.

I work on an island offshore of North Western Australia with 7000 or so others. It's an A class nature reserve with super tight restrictions of what I can bring into the island. Pretty much our whole diet isn't allowed ( unless it's processed which I avoid). All of our food is provided. \nUnfortunately 95% of it is contaminated animal products. They even put bacon in the cabbage and beans then put it in the vegetarian menu labeled as cabbage and bacon. \nOver 8 months of me pointing things like that out. Intentionally requesting special meals off busy chefs. Making head chefs have to walk away from whatever they are doing to get someone to open me a can of kidney beans has paid off. \nThanks to some other mysterious vegans on the island I am yet to meet, we now have a vegan section for lunches. \nNow I fight for a vegan protein source for dinner every night! \n\nI feel bad I irritated busy people just doing their job. However I'm glad it all finally paid off. \n\nI now can get all the lentils, rice and veggies I want without having animals in it. \n\nOne change at a time.

I feel like a lot of people around me just revert back to eating meat after the 'shock' wears off. The people in this group are so kind and caring and I feel to a degree that we are more sensitive than most of the people out there in the world. Perhaps trying to use the selling point of vegan health, longer life, healthier hair, better skin, better digestion will cause people to stay vegan for longer or make it more desirable.... as in people will want to do it out of a genuine desire to 'look attractive', longer their life/better their health rather than just shock at the world? I feel like cruelty photos are effective as a trigger.. but a lot of humans are so desensitised these days that the shock wears off after a while or it doesn't shock them at all. Take me for an example, Earthlings shocked me and made me feel pathetic for endorsing the industry.... BUT it was the cruelty and the mutual benefit of health and bettering my life that sold me on being vegan?

I must say that up until now I have kept my cooking mostly clean and simple although I love to cook and I do get like to make an effort... and of course I love to eat but I thought as I we will have Christmas dinner with my Mum and friends, who are not vegan (but always respect us and eat with us while in our home, also I think mum is leaning towards veganism and I'm hoping to convince her with my awesome cooking, and maybe others too). anyway I'm rambling, so I thought that if I make some stuff to slowly ease the meat eaters into no meat it would be good too.

Pretty much our whole diet isn't allowed ( unless it's processed which I avoid). All of our food is provided. \nUnfortunately 95% of it is contaminated animal products. They even put bacon in the cabbage and beans then put it in the vegetarian menu labeled as cabbage and bacon. \nOver 8 months of me pointing things like that out. Intentionally requesting special meals off busy chefs. Making head chefs have to walk away from whatever they are doing to get someone to open me a can of kidney beans has paid off. \nThanks to some other mysterious vegans on the island I am yet to meet, we now have a vegan section for lunches. \nNow I fight for a vegan protein source for dinner every night! \n\nI feel bad I irritated busy people just doing their job.

But i recently came across this vegan girl's post who was proud of herself for posting a picture of a tortured  cow on a friend's photograph having a family dinner at a stake house.  The friend obviously deleted it and sent her a private msg about how rude she was and they are no longer friends. Now this is not about being the most balsy vegan and bragging about it, but about having effective communication skill in order to reach a condiditioned society. To add she had some reall aggressive friends who are all planning to wage a violent war on meat eaters. She claims that she will also be on the front line of this war.","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/784464031615276","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/784464031615276","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"December 01, 2014 at 12:26PM","Sharri Lembryk ॐ","Vegan advent calendars...

My brother doesn't even have the balls to watch it by the way, parents have though which somehow makes it worse coz they still eat meat about 3 times a day. My brother then came out and said he's an animal lover (he loves his dogs) and I said how can you love animals but eat meat which he was offended by. He answered with the now very old \"we need meat to survive\" comment. Very over my family right now, can't believe they can be so callous. I'm grateful I have Dianne Stadelmaier for my wife.

Angry aggressive vegans driving people away from the cause. Dont get me wrong I'm all for preaching,  educating and being direct. But i recently came across this vegan girl's post who was proud of herself for posting a picture of a tortured  cow on a friend's photograph having a family dinner at a stake house.  The friend obviously deleted it and sent her a private msg about how rude she was and they are no longer friends. Now this is not about being the most balsy vegan and bragging about it, but about having effective communication skill in order to reach a condiditioned society. To add she had some reall aggressive friends who are all planning to wage a violent war on meat eaters. She claims that she will also be on the front line of this war.","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/784464031615276","https://www.facebook.com/435237999871216/posts/784464031615276","Sydney Vegans"],[null,"December 01, 2014 at 07:09PM","Andrew Taylor","I'm a bit sick of people saying \"I respect your opinion so you should respect mine!\" Actually it's not that simple.

Since so many costumes involve corsetry of some kind, I thought this two-day course may be of interest to some of you :)\n\n\" 'Corsetry for Beginners' by Vanyanís. This is a fantastic opportunity to learn from one of the experts in the industry in Australia's only corsetry course taught by a full time corsetiere. Quality materials and pattern (from Sew Curvy) are included in the cost, along with morning & afternoon tea, venue hire and tutelage. In this course you will learn to make your very own, perfectly fitted underbust corset and will come away with the knowledge and confidence to further explore this fine craft. To avoid disappointment, book quickly as places will fill up fast. We recommend printing out the flyer and leaving it somewhere obvious for your partner or family to treat you for Christmas!

Once things cool down it's cool to post \"does anyone know this cosplayer\" type of posts though IMO.

So please cosplayers don't repost the same stuff repeatedly and photographers please only put up links to albums and not post separate images, comments on people asking for photos would be sweet though :) Otherwise this gets clogged quickly and takes forever to scroll through. Once things cool down it's cool to post \"does anyone know this cosplayer\" type of posts though IMO. As a photographer it's good to make separate albums for each day, or even an extra one for shots from a competition, makes it easier for the cosplayers to find themselves.","https://www.facebook.com/483677861648205/posts/994040387278614","https://www.facebook.com/483677861648205/posts/994040387278614","Supanovah Photo Find Forum"],[null,"November 27, 2014 at 10:27PM","Tyler Wortley","hey guys ill be going all 3 days on Friday i am warrior jack frost on Saturday i shall be the 12th doctor and finally on sunday i will be starkiller :) come find me ill have business cards :)","https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=925189410833744&set=gm.994070733942246&type=1&relevant_count=1","https://www.facebook.com/483677861648205/posts/994070733942246","Supanovah Photo Find Forum"],[null,"November 27, 2014 at 10:57PM","Maddy Best","If you guys see me on Saturday please come talk to me!
