Phosphorylation at this site by mTORC2 stimulates Akt activity (PMID 15718470).,S474,Q60823,9445477,1p6s31272,Akt,"Found in the activation loop of the kinase domain, and is phosphorylated by PDK1 (PMID 9094314, 9445477, 9228007). This primes Akt for a second phosphorylation (at S474) for complete activation (e.g., PMID 23684622).",T309,Q60823,15718470,1p6s
